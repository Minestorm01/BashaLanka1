# BashaLanka — Sinhala Learning App

## Overview
BashaLanka is a language learning application focused on teaching Sinhala (the primary language of Sri Lanka). The app uses a game-like, interactive approach similar to Duolingo, with various exercise types including matching pairs, translation, listening comprehension, and speaking practice.

## Project Type
Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application (no backend required)
- Framework-free, accessible, and mobile-first design
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities with service worker
- Hash-based client-side routing

## Recent Changes (2025-10-27)
- **Lesson Access**: All users can now start lessons (previously admin-only)
- **Characters View**: New view with Sinhala character grid, audio playback, and practice
- **Practice Builder**: Custom practice session configurator with mode/exercise/duration selection
- **Quests System**: Daily and weekly challenges with progress tracking and rewards
- **Landing Page**: Dedicated home view for new users with hero section and feature cards
- Fixed routing to properly handle home view
- Removed undefined connectLessons() call that was causing console errors

## Previous Changes (2025-10-26)
- Initial GitHub import to Replit
- Set up Node.js development environment
- Configured http-server for local development on port 5000
- Added .gitignore for Node.js and Replit files
- Created workflow for automatic server startup

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Routing**: Hash-based client-side routing
- **PWA**: Service Worker (sw.js) with manifest
- **Server**: http-server (development) - static file serving only
- **Module Loading**: Dynamic ES6 imports for exercise modules

### Data Flow
- Course structure defined in `assets/Lessons/course.map.json`
- Lesson content stored in Markdown files
- Exercise data in JSON files under `/data/`
- User progress stored in localStorage
- Audio files served statically from `assets/Sinhala_Audio/`

## Development Setup

### Running Locally
The app is configured to run on port 5000 using http-server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the server on `0.0.0.0:5000` with:
- CORS enabled for development
- Cache disabled (`-c-1`) for instant updates
- Accessible from Replit webview

### Environment
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (required for Replit proxy)
- **Port**: 5000 (only port exposed in Replit)
- **Base Path**: Auto-detected based on hosting environment
  - Localhost/Replit: `./`
  - GitHub Pages: `/BashaLanka/`

### Configuration
The app automatically detects its environment and adjusts asset paths:
- Uses `REPO_BASE_PATH` variable for path resolution
- Supports both relative (`./`) and absolute (`/`) paths
- Works on localhost, Replit, and GitHub Pages deployments

## Deployment
The project is ready for deployment as a static site. Suitable platforms:
- Replit (current)
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any static hosting service

## User Preferences
None specified yet - this is the initial setup.

## Notes
- No backend required - all data is client-side
- Login is mock (localStorage only) with "admin" username for debug access
- Service worker currently has no caching strategy implemented
- All audio files are pre-recorded MP3s (fast/slowed versions)
