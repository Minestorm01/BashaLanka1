🦁 BashaLanka — Remaining Feature Implementations (Functional Overview Only)

This document explains which views and systems are still incomplete in the current BashaLanka build, how they should work conceptually, and what behavior to implement next.
No code required — just the logic, data flow, and intended functionality.

1. Characters View (#view-characters)

Current state:

The route exists and renders a header (Characters) and an empty <div id="charGrid" class="card-grid">.

There’s no script that loads or populates the characters into this grid.

Intended behavior:

The Characters view will act as a Character Mastery hub — the foundation for Sinhala script learning.

It should display a grid of character cards (vowels, consonants, combos), grouped by learning stage.

Each card shows the Sinhala character, transliteration, pronunciation, and a “Start Practice” button.

Clicking a card launches the same exercise interface as the main lessons but limited to character-based tasks (e.g., match pairs, listening, or writing trace).

Progress for each character (e.g., mastered %, accuracy) should show below the card.

Data source idea:

Pull data from a YAML/JSON file such as assets/Lessons/characters.map.json or a similar file containing metadata for each letter group.

Example structure: { "group": "Short Vowels", "chars": [{ "si": "අ", "roman": "a", "audio": "a.mp3", "lessonId": "char_01" }] }

2. Practice View (#view-practice)

Current state:

Currently a static message: “Custom practice sessions coming soon.”

Intended behavior:

The Practice view allows users to create custom practice sessions by selecting:

One or more completed lessons

Exercise types (e.g., translation, listening)

Skill focus (e.g., “recent mistakes,” “characters,” “verbs”)

The interface should display:

A configuration panel (dropdowns, toggles, or checkboxes)

A “Start Practice” button that dynamically launches a practice session using the existing Lesson Simulator engine.

XP and streak rewards still apply here, but practice sessions won’t unlock new content.

Technical connection:

This view uses the same exercise modules (TranslateToBase, MatchPairs, etc.) already used by the debug tools.

It needs a non-admin entry point into those modules.

3. Quests View (#view-quests)

Current state:

Displays title and an empty <div id="questsList" class="card-list">.

Intended behavior:

The Quests screen is for daily and long-term challenges.

It should display a list of quest cards, each with:

Quest title and description

Progress bar (e.g., “Complete 3 lessons today — 2/3 done”)

XP or badge reward shown on completion

Quests refresh daily or weekly and encourage practice beyond structured lessons.

Data source idea:

Could use a static JSON file like assets/data/quests.json, structured as:

[
  { "id": "daily_01", "title": "Daily Warm-up", "desc": "Complete one lesson", "progress": 0.5, "reward": "20 XP" },
  { "id": "weekly_02", "title": "Grammar Master", "desc": "Finish 10 exercises", "progress": 0.2, "reward": "Badge: Grammar Guru" }
]


Once loaded, each quest populates the list dynamically.

4. Exercises Access for Regular Users

Current state:

Exercises are only accessible via the admin-only debug panel inside the Profile view.

Regular users have no way to start a lesson or exercise directly.

Intended behavior:

Non-admin users should be able to click a lesson node in the Learn or Characters view to launch exercises.

The app should use the Lesson Simulator UI (currently built for admin debug) as the universal exercise launcher.

Add a lightweight “Start Lesson” button inside each lesson card that triggers LessonSimulator.open() with the appropriate lesson and exercise data.

Outcome:

Every user (not just “admin”) can begin lessons naturally from the Learn path.

5. Landing Page (#/home)

Current state:

The router treats #/home and #/learn as the same route, both loading the Learn view.

There is no standalone landing/marketing screen.

Intended behavior:

Create a dedicated Landing Page (#view-home) for first-time visitors before login or signup.

This view highlights:

BashaLanka logo and tagline

“Start Learning” or “Continue” button

Short description, screenshots, or character previews

Returning users with progress go directly to Learn; new visitors see this landing first.
