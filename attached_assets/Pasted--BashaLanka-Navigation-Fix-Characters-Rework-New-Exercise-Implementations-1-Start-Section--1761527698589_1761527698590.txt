🦁 BashaLanka — Navigation Fix + Characters Rework + New Exercise Implementations
1. “Start Section” Navigation Fix

Current issue:
Clicking “Start Section 1” currently redirects users to the home screen instead of showing the section’s lessons.

Intended behavior:

Clicking Start Section 1, Start Section 2, etc. should bring the user back to the Learn view, not a new screen.

The Learn view should automatically:

Scroll to or focus on the selected section’s container.

Expand that section’s Units grid immediately (if collapsed).

Show all lesson coins for that section’s units (so the user can click individual lessons right away).

No extra routing like #/section/1 needed — stay within the Learn page logic.

The goal: preserve the simple path
Home → Learn → [Section Expanded] → Lesson Coins → LessonSimulator
so users can jump right back into visible content.

Optional polish:

Add a smooth scroll animation to the section’s card when opened.

Temporarily highlight the section header (like a short glowing border or bounce animation) to show where the user landed.

2. Characters Page Rework

Current issue:
The Characters page currently mixes Sinhala letters with example words and common phrases.

Intended behavior:

Rebuild the Characters view to focus exclusively on the Sinhala script itself, not vocabulary.

Organize characters into three clear groups:

Vowels (අ – ඕ)

Consonants (ක – හ)

Combined Forms / Modifiers (e.g., කා, කි, කු, කෝ)

Each character card should include:

The Sinhala glyph in large type.

Romanized transliteration underneath.

An audio playback button for pronunciation.

A progress indicator (localStorage-based mastery).

A “Practice” button to open the corresponding mini-exercise (e.g., Match Pairs, Listening).

Removed content:

Delete all “Common Phrases” or “Word Examples” sections from this view.

Characters are taught in isolation — example words move to regular lessons.

Goal:
A clean, focused Character Mastery Hub — no phrases, just script learning.

3. New Exercise Types to Implement

We’ve implemented Match Pairs and both translation exercises.
Now, code the five remaining exercise modules to complete the full interactive library.

🖼️ Picture Choice

Show an English or Sinhala cue.

Display 3–4 image options.

User clicks the matching picture.

Highlight correct/incorrect instantly and proceed.

✍️ Fill in the Blank

Show a sentence with a missing word (“මම ___ ඉන්නවා”).

Several options appear below; user chooses the correct one.

Provide instant feedback and continue.

🎧 Listening

Play Sinhala audio.

User either:

Selects matching translation (multiple choice), or

Types what they heard (dictation mode).

Include “replay” and “slow” buttons.

💬 Dialogue

Step-by-step conversation simulation between two speakers.

User picks their reply from multiple responses after each prompt.

Visual speech bubbles for flow clarity.

🗣️ Speaking

Uses microphone input (Web Speech API).

Prompts user to say Sinhala words aloud.

Compares recognized speech with expected Romanized or Sinhala string (approximate match is fine).

Gives feedback: ✅ “Good pronunciation!” or ❌ “Try again.”

All new exercise modules must:

Follow the same structure:

export default async function init({ target, onComplete }) { ... }


Live under assets/Lessons/exercises/<ExerciseName>/index.js

Trigger onComplete() when finished so LessonSimulator can advance.

Use shared styles and theme variables from existing CSS (translate-to-base, etc.).
